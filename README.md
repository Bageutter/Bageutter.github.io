# Intro
This is my first github page! As of the 29/05/2025, I have decided I will begin a not so regular blog for the sake of hashing out my ideas/thoughts on specific topics. Right now it will be more of a jarbled mess of nonsense, and maybe if I feel bothered enough, I can turn it into something cool.

## What do I intend to gain?
TBF, no clue :)
I will find a proper use for this, and maybe I'll learn something out of this, but it's just an open book right now

## What will I cover?
Everything and anything under the sun that I find interesting. As for particular topics? Here's a not-so-definite list I would probably fall back to when I run out of ideas:
- Literary Analysis
- The Psychology of Communication
- Technical Deployments
- Cybersecurity
- Routing and Networking
- Photography and arts

## Closing statements
If you are me, this blog is kinda like a message in a bottle. There is no guarantee I will remember whatever tf I was on when writing it, nor is there a guarantee that I will stand by what I have said in the past. What you should hopefully remember and hold true is that this is suppose to mark your growth throughout the years (hopefully), and or watch how this blog dies in a few months from creation :(
If you are not me, this blog would be nothing more than a brief introspective on who I am as a person, and my view of the world. Think nothing more than it being a poorly updated story with too many logical fallacies, and an unreliable narrator. Actually, scratch that - don't think of this at all because it is all the more embarrasing for the both of us
